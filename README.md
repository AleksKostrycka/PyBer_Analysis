# **PyBer Analysis Challange**
## **Analysis Overview**
The purpose of this analysis was to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type. Using the skills learned in this Module the intent was to create a DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type, then using Pandas and Matplotlib create a multi-line graph that shows the weekly fares for each city type. 
## **Results**
The purpose of Deliverable #1 was to complete a ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type. Using the Jupyter Notebook we were able to create this DataFrame by grouping information into three categories, or types of cities, Rural, Suburban and Urban. The summary DataFrame includes the following information for each of the city categories, within a specific period January - April. 
* Total rides 
* Total drivers 
* Total fares 
* Average fare per ride 
* Average fare per driver
